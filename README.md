## 3D Puzzles with origami cubes

Let's make a puzzle of "decomposition of a cube", using origami.

The building block of this is the traditional Sonobe units for modular origami. You can find a tutorial on:

The modular units are displayed below.

One cube as photo.

We can do more cubes like this, and glue two or more of them to make the pieces of our puzzle.

To design the puzzle, 

There are endless variations.

We will have, in total, 27 unit cubes. For each cube we need 6 pieces of paper, resulting in 162 pieces of paper, glue, and a lot of pacience, to assembly this puzzle!
