# Mathematical proofs with cardboard and paper

In this tutorial, we'll show Mathematical visual proofs, using cardboard and paper!

This ludic tecnique is specially good for children. These math proofs will be like puzzles. Best of all, you can do it yourself, at home.

There are two parts: 2D puzzles, with cardboard; and 3D puzzles, with origami paper!

# Part 1 - 2D Puzzles

## (a+b)² = a² + 2ab + b²

The visualization of (a+b)² = a² + 2ab + b² can be showed with rectangles.

The sides are proportional to a and b.

You can show the relation of sizes of the pieces to the children.

## Sum of internal angles of a triangle

For any triangle...

![](triangle01.jpeg)

The sum of internal angles is 180 degrees.

## Pythagorean theorem

The famous Pythagorean theorem can also be a funny puzzle.

![](Pitagoras_esquema.PNG)

Draw the triangle rectangle in a cardboard, with squares in the legs and in the hypotenuse.

In this example, this is a 3 - 4 - 5 triangle

Make little squares with the 5 x 5 big square, and fit the pieces in the hypotenuse square.

The same pieces can fit in the legs squares, showing visually the proof.

## Calculating the value of pi

With a cardboad circle and a line, we can have the size of the circunference of a circle.

Measuring the radius (in this case, 2.7mm).

Measuring the circunference (17.2 mm)

![](circle03.png)

The formula is 2 * pi * r = C

2 * pi * 2.7 = 17.2

pi = 	3.18

I believe we can get better estimates with a more skilled measurement...


## 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + ... = 1

The series 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + ... = 1 can fit a square of size 1 x 1, as shown below.

![](Soma_meio_esquema.PNG)

![](somameio_01.jpeg)

We can see the relation of sizes of the pieces of the puzzle.

## Sum of odd integers

The sum of odd integers is a square:
1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2*n+1) = n²

![](135_esquema.PNG)

Here we see strips with sizes proportional to the numbers 1, 3, 5, 7.

![](somaImpares_01.jpeg)

The pieces can be combined to fit a square!

## (a+b+c)² = a² + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc + b² + c²

Similarly, there is a nice visualization of (a+b+c)² = a² + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc + b² + c²

Showing the pieces side by side:

## Suggestions


You can also try to make at home other visual proofs.

Pythagoras: there are several other visual and interesting proofs. One particularly interesting and easy to be done at home is the one below.

![](pitagoras_alt.png)

Sum of quarters. In the same spirit as the presented proofs, the sum of quarters is interesting to be done in cardboard puzzles format:

Fibonacci. The always beautiful Fibonacci sequence can be visualized using squares of sizes 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and so on.

# 3D puzzles with origami cubes


The building block for the 3D puzzles is the traditional Sonobe units for modular origami. You can find a tutorial on:

[https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/modular-origami-cube-box-4082281](https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/modular-origami-cube-box-4082281)

The modular units are displayed below.

We can do more cubes like this, and glue two or more of them to make the pieces of our puzzle.



## (a+b)³ = a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³

We can easily visualize the above formula using 3D cubes.

![](abcubo_esquema.PNG)


Considering a = 2 and b = 1, we have one 2x2x2 cube, three 2x2x1 cuboids, three 1x1x2 cuboids, and one 1x1x1 cube.

![](ab_cubo01.jpeg)

These pieces form a 3x3x3 cube, as shown below.

![](ab_cubo02.jpeg)


We will have, in total, 27 unit cubes. For each cube we need 6 pieces of paper, resulting in 162 pieces of paper, glue, and a lot of pacience, to assembly this puzzle!
