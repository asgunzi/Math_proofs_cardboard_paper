# Mathematical proofs with paper and carboard

In this tutorial, we'll show Mathematical visual proofs, using paper and cardboard!

This ludic tecnique is specially good for children. These math proofs will be like puzzles.


## (a+b)² = a² + 2ab + b²

The visualization of (a+b)² = a² + 2ab + b² can be showed with rectangles, where the sides are proportional to a and b.

You can show the relation of sizes of the pieces to the children.

## 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + ... = 1

The series 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + ... = 1 can fit a square of size 1 x 1, as shown below.

We can see the relation of sizes of the pieces of the puzzle.

## Pythagorean theorem

The famous Pythagorean theorem can also be a funny puzzle.

Draw the triangle rectangle in a cardboard, with squares in the legs and.
hypotenuse.

In this example, this is a 3 - 4 - 5 triangle

Make little squares with the 5 x 5 big square, and fit the pieces in the hypotenuse square.

The same pieces can fit in the legs squares, showing visually the proof.

## Sum of odd integers

The sum of odd integers is a square:
1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2*n+1) = n²

Here we see strips with sizes proportional to the numbers 1, 3, 5, 7.

The pieces can be combined to fit a square!

## (a+b+c)² = a² + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc + b² + c²

Similarly, there is a nice visualization of (a+b+c)² = a² + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc + b² + c²

## Suggestions

You can also try to make at home other visual proofs.




## 3D Puzzles with origami cubes

Let's make a puzzle of "decomposition of a cube", using origami.

The building block of this is the traditional Sonobe units for modular origami. You can find a tutorial on:

https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/modular-origami-cube-box-4082281

The modular units are displayed below.

One cube as photo.

We can do more cubes like this, and glue two or more of them to make the pieces of our puzzle.

To design the puzzle, 

There are endless variations.

We will have, in total, 27 unit cubes. For each cube we need 6 pieces of paper, resulting in 162 pieces of paper, glue, and a lot of pacience, to assembly this puzzle!
